# Air-Quality-Sensor-Scripts

These are the scripts I wrote or used in my air quality sensor package project.
The sensors used are:
* MQ7 carbon monoxide sensor
* MQ2 flammable gases sensor
* DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor
* Grove PPD42NS dust sensor

There are versions created for the Arduino and ESP8266 with code written in C++, and versions for the Raspberry Pi 3 written in Python.

The code present in the *libraries* folder are existing Arduino libraries that I have used in creating my sensor package.
Credit for those goes to the original owner of those scripts.
